Sick of restarting your server?
So far, when you change your code, you have to stop your server and start it again.
This can get repetitive! To alleviate this problem, you can install a tool called node-
mon, which will watch all of your files for changes and restart if it detects any.
You can install nodemon by running npm install nodemon --global.
Once itâ€™s installed, you can start a file in watch mode by replacing node with nodemon
in your command. If you typed node app.js earlier, just change it to nodemon app.js,
and your app will continuously reload when it changes.
